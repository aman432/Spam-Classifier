# Spam-Classifier
A spam classifier based on machine learning concepts, It uses Support Vector Machine(SVM) as a model. It first preprocess data by Lower-casing, Stripping HTML, Normalizing URLs, Normalizing Email Addresses, Normalizing Numbers, Word Stemming, Removal of non-words. Trained a classifier to classify whether a given email, x, is spam (y = 1) or non-spam (y = 0). In particular, it converted each email into a feature vector x ∈ R n . Then developed a Vocabulary list which matches indices with the spam mail and stores the indices in a vector and makes the feature x i ∈ {0, 1} for an email corresponds to whether the i-th word in the dictionary occurs in the email. That is, x i = 1 if the i-th word is in the email and x i = 0 if the i-th word is not present in the email.  After loading the dataset, it will proceed to train a SVM to classify between spam (y = 1) and non-spam (y = 0) emails. Once the training completes, saw that the classifier gets a training accuracy of about 99.8% and a test accuracy of about 98.5%.
